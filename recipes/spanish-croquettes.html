    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat 1/2 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until a smooth paste forms.</li>
      <li>Very slowly drizzle in the milk and chicken broth, stirring constantly, until well combined. This can take up to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the nutmeg, and salt, and pepper to taste. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture is thick, smooth, with a consistency similar to mashed potatoes.</li>
      <li>Lower the heat to low. Add the minced ham, stirring constantly until well combined, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
      <li>Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Refrigerate until the mixture is cold, about 3 hours. If you are preparing a day or so ahead, you can cover the mixture tightly and keep refrigerated until you are ready to fry the croquettes.</li>
      <li>Beat the eggs with the water in a separate small, shallow bowl.</li>
      <li>Pour the breadcrumbs into another small, shallow bowl.</li>
      <li>Cover your hands in flour, then divide the mixture into 1-inch balls or oblong pieces. Set on a plate so that they are not touching. </li>
      <li>Add about 1/2-inch oil to a large skillet or other heavy-duty pan and heat to 355 F.</li>
      <li>Dip the croquettes in the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Fry the croquettes in batches, turning several times, until golden.</li>
      <li>Remove the croquettes with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If the croquettes mixture is spread out in a thin layer on a flat dish before chilling, you will need to refrigerate it for less time. A large glass baking dish works well.</li>
      <li>If you prefer, you can use a deep fryer to fry the croquettes. Be sure not to overcook them.</li>
      <li>You can make the dough ahead of time and freeze it. Take the croquette dough out of the freezer to thaw, form into balls, and coat in breadcrumbs, and fry. If you have enough freezer space, you can even freeze breaded croquette, then all you have to do is fry them up.</li>
      <li>If the croquettes will not be served immediately, place in a warm oven (200 F) for up to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
